Here's a detailed breakdown of the concepts within Task Statement 1.1 through 1.4 of Domain 1: Data Ingestion and Transformation:

**Task Statement 1.1: Perform Data Ingestion**

* **Throughput and Latency:** Understand the difference between throughput (the amount of data processed over time) and latency (the delay in processing data). Knowing the characteristics of different AWS services helps choose the right tool for the job. For instance, Kinesis is ideal for high-throughput real-time streaming, while S3 is better suited for large batch uploads.
* **Data Ingestion Patterns:** Recognize the frequency with which data arrives (e.g., continuous, hourly, daily) and whether you need to retain historical data. This helps you decide whether to use streaming or batch ingestion methods.
* **Streaming Ingestion:** Involves continuously processing data as it arrives, often from sources like sensors or clickstreams. AWS Kinesis and MSK are key services here.
* **Batch Ingestion:** Involves processing data in chunks at scheduled intervals or when triggered by events. This is suitable for less time-sensitive data. S3, Glue, and EMR are commonly used for batch ingestion.
* **Replayability:** The ability to reprocess data from the beginning if needed (e.g., in case of an error).  Kinesis and MSK support this by storing data for a configurable period.
* **Stateful vs. Stateless Transactions:** Stateful transactions maintain context between operations, while stateless ones don't.  DynamoDB streams, for instance, can be used to maintain state in data pipelines.

**Task Statement 1.2: Transform and Process Data**

* **ETL Pipelines:** Design and create Extract, Transform, Load pipelines that take raw data, clean it, restructure it, and load it into a target system. Business requirements dictate the structure of these pipelines.
* **Volume, Velocity, Variety:**  The three Vs of big data. Understand the impact of data volume (amount), velocity (speed of arrival), and variety (structured, unstructured, semi-structured) on your processing choices.
* **Cloud and Distributed Computing:** Leverage the scalability and parallel processing power of cloud platforms like AWS to handle large and complex data transformations.
* **Apache Spark:**  A powerful framework for distributed data processing. Learn how to use Spark on AWS services like EMR for transforming large datasets.
* **Data Staging:** Identify where to temporarily store intermediate data during transformations. S3 is a common choice.

**Task Statement 1.3: Orchestrate Data Pipelines**

* **AWS Service Integration:** Understand how different AWS services work together to build complete data pipelines (e.g., using Glue for ETL, Lambda for custom logic, S3 for storage).
* **Event-Driven Architecture:** Design pipelines that react to events (e.g., a new file uploaded to S3), allowing for more dynamic and real-time processing.
* **Scheduling and Dependencies:**  Configure AWS services like EventBridge or Airflow to schedule pipeline steps based on time or dependencies between tasks.
* **Serverless Workflows:** Utilize serverless technologies like Step Functions to build workflows without managing underlying infrastructure.

**Task Statement 1.4: Apply Programming Concepts**

* **CI/CD:** Implement practices like continuous integration and continuous delivery to automate testing and deployment of data pipelines, ensuring faster iterations and fewer errors.
* **SQL Queries:**  Know how to write SQL to extract and transform data within databases like Redshift or Athena.
* **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Use tools like CloudFormation or CDK to define your pipeline infrastructure as code, making it easy to replicate and manage.
* **Distributed Computing:** Understand concepts like data partitioning and parallelization to design scalable data processing systems.
* **Data Structures and Algorithms:** Apply basic knowledge of data structures (arrays, lists, trees, graphs) and algorithms (sorting, searching) to optimize data transformations.
* **SQL Query Optimization:**  Learn techniques to write efficient SQL queries that run faster and consume fewer resources.
